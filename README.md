I'm fed up with jquery / cheerio on node side of things
all i ever wanted was to make elements with:

$('<div>', {
	property: whatever you want to insert,
	property2: whatever you want to insert2,
});

and have those support 
.append()
.prepend()
.html()

Simple enough? i think so haha

mind you i wrote this for myself so that i could avoid frontend js rendering :P
